        <p>Science is an amzing things it can give an explanation about the world around you and open new worlds. Science is the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.</p> <br />
        <p>There are four major branches of science; each branch is categorized in diffrent types of subjects that cover diffrent areas of studies such as chemisty, pysics, math, astronomy ect. The four major branches of science are, Mathematics and logic, Biological science, Pysical Science and Social science. </p> <br />
        <p> Life science, also known as biology, is the natural science that studies life such as microorganisms, plants, and animals including human beings, including their physical structure, chemical processes, molecular interactions, physiological mechanisms, development, and evolution. Biology is a branch of science that deals with living organisms and their vital processes. Biology encompasses diverse fields, including botany, conservation, ecology, evolution, genetics, marine biology, medicine, microbiology, molecular biology, physiology, and zoology. </p> <br />
        <p> Biology is the study of life. In general, biologists study the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution and distribution of living organisms. Biology is important because it helps us understand how living things work and how they function and interact on multiple levels, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p> <br />
        <p> Synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes. Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel biomolecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms.
